# Pi Arcade Games 🎮

Retro terminal arcade for [Pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Play classic games while you wait for builds, tests, and long-running tasks.

![Pi Arcade Games Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkingjh999/pi-arcade-games/main/docs/demo.gif)

**18 games** built in — with bilingual (English / 中文) menu support and **auto-save**.

## 💾 Auto-Save

Every game automatically saves your progress when you exit. Come back anytime and pick up right where you left off.

```
    ╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║      P I   A R C A D E   G A M E S     ║
    ╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

  ▸ [1]  2048            ···  Slide & merge tiles
    [2]  Battleship      ···  Naval combat vs AI
    [3]  Snake           ···  Eat food, grow, don't crash  💾

    💾 Continue: Snake
```

- **💾 badge** — appears next to games with saved progress
- **Continue prompt** — shows at the bottom so you can jump right back in
- **Per-game state** — each game stores its own save independently (score, board, position…)

Just select the game with 💾 and you're back in action. No manual saving needed.

## Writing Your Own Game 🛠️

Pi Arcade Games is designed to be extensible. Anyone can write a game and submit a PR!

**Quick overview:**

1. Create a `.ts` file in `extensions/games/builtin/`
2. Export a `GameModule` object with `meta` + `register()`
3. Implement a TUI `Component` with `render()`, `handleInput()`, `invalidate()`
4. Register a menu entry via `registerMenuEntry()`

👉 **See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** for the full guide with a working template game.
